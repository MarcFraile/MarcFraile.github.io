                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am currently employed at the Center for Statistical Genetics in the University of Michigan, where I help maintain the
                        <a href="https://imputation.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov" target="_blank">TOPMed Imputation Server</a>. This free tool helps
                        thousands of scientists worldwide perform their genomics research.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Previously, I obtained a PhD from Uppsala University (Sweden), in which I studied the application
                        of modern Computer Vision (CV) to Social Signal Processing (SSP) and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI).
                        My thesis, <i>"Computer Vision and Explainability in Human-Human and Human-Robot Interaction"</i>,
                        investigated the applicability of end-to-end Deep Learning techniques to predict social behaviour during guided play.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since social interaction datasets obtained through controlled experiments tend to be very small, the research community typically
                        prefers the use of pre-trained feature extractors, combined with shallow ML models. Me and my collaborators showed that in some cirumstances the
                        end-to-end approach can be superior, though it can also fail if the social signals are sufficiently subtle. To support this analysis,
                        we collected <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12635621" target="_blank">the UpStory dataset</a>, a novel social interaction dataset
                        in an educational context.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also investigated the use of Explainable AI (XAI) in Computer Vision, and proposed an approach to objectively compare different <i>"attention map"</i> techniques. I further studied the use of XAI as an aid to help users of a Social Robot understand how the robot is working.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My project was funded by Uppsala University's <a href="https://www.math.uu.se/research/cim/" target="_blank">Centre for Interdisciplinary Mathematics (CIM)</a>,
                        and by the Swedish Research Council's ELECTRA project (grant no. 2020-03167).
                        I was a member of the <a href="https://usr-lab.github.io/" target="_blank">Uppsala Social Robotics Lab (USRL)</a>,
                        as well as <a href="https://www.it.uu.se/about_us/divisions/vi3/research/mida" target="_blank">Methods for Image Data Analysis (MIDA)</a>.

                            Aditya Harichandar joined the Uppsala Social Robotics Lab as a student intern in Autumn 2023.
                            Under my supervision, he curated an audio feature dataset based on the data collected in my paper
                            <i>"UpStory: the Uppsala Storytelling dataset"</i>, and performed rapport prediction using both
                            feature-based methods (using scikit-learn) and audio-based methods (using PyTorch). He also worked on replicating my published
                            video-based results, and exploring modality fusion variants to perform audiovisual prediction.
                            His work culminated in the defense of his masters thesis in Spring 2024, in which I acted as the supervisor.

                            Master's level course with a focus on the hands-on design and implementation of conversational agents.
                            Duties: design of learning materials, teaching lab sessions, grading homework, supervising and grading final projects.
                            Due to ongoing evolution of the field, I was asked to re-design and teach part of the course in three consecutive editions.
